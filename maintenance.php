				<h1>A Warm &amp; Welcoming
				<span class="soft-break">Montessori Experience</span></h1>

				<p>Heartwood Montessori School is a child-centered community who focuses on providing an excellent, whole-child, Montessori education. Our classrooms are staffed with warm, caring, Montessori (American Montessori Society, or AMS)  certified teachers and equipped with the full complement of Montessori materials for their respective age groups.</p>

				<p>Peace Education is at the <strong>HEART</strong> of every aspect of our curriculum and it shows in the strong community we build among the students, parents and staff. Believing that a sense of respect for self, others, and the environment (wherever one finds oneself) is the surest path to peace, we attempt to model it in everything we do, from the way we interact with each other to the way the adults treat the materials in the classrooms, to the way we model conflict resolution to the children.</p>

				<h1>Quality Education for Students 18 Months to 18 Years</h1>

				<p>Heartwood Montessori School serves students aged 18 months to 18 years. In addition to the Montessori curriculum presented by our certified teachers, students participate in: Art, Physical Education, Yoga, Foreign Language (Spanish for 18 mos-12 year-olds) and Movement for the younger students. There are also private violin, guitar and piano lessons available on campus</p>

					<h1>Our Philosophy</h1>

					<p>The cornerstone of Heartwood's philosophy is one that is at the root of Montessori philosophy: respect for the child and his/her cognitive, social and emotional development.  We recognize, as trained Montessorians, that children go through sensitive periods during which they are more open to receiving certain lessons and concepts.  By carefully looking for, recognizing and respecting these planes of development, teachers are able to maximize student learning while maintaining and even expanding the childâ€™s natural curiosity about the world and interest in learning.</p>

					<p>As we are unceasingly engaged in Peace Education, we believe that one of the most important aspects of our school is that we provide an environment, both in the classroom and out, that encourages the development of peaceful individuals who engage in thoughtful, compassionate interactions with others.</p>
